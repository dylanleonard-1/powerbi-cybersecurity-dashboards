<hr>

Welcome to a purpose-built portfolio of interactive cybersecurity dashboards built entirely in **Power BI**, designed to simulate real-world threat visibility, IAM hygiene monitoring, and compliance posture across enterprise environments.

This project demonstrates how **data analytics and security operations intersect** to power faster decision-making, stronger detection capabilities, and streamlined compliance — all through compelling, interactive dashboards.

## Why This Project Matters

Security teams today are overwhelmed with alerts, audit pressure, and identity risks — but lack visual clarity across their data. I created this project to bridge that gap.

Using simulated log files and structured datasets, I built visual tools a **SOC analyst**, **IAM engineer**, or **GRC leader** could use to make critical decisions fast.

These dashboards reflect exactly what you’d use in a real enterprise — with the added bonus of being fully interactive and built for storytelling.

## Core Skills Demonstrated

- **Power BI** (data modeling, visuals, DAX measures)
- **Security Analytics** (alert classification, identity trends, compliance controls)
- **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)** understanding
- **STAR-format communication** (project breakdowns for real interviews)
- **Dashboard design thinking** (for leadership, SOC, IAM, and audit teams)
- **Live publishing via Power BI Web Embed** (coming soon)
