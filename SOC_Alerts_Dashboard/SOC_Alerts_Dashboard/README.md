# SOC Alerts Dashboard

**Interactive Power BI Dashboard for Real-World SOC Alert Triage and Threat Monitoring**

> *"Built to mirror the daily grind of a Tier 1/2 SOC analyst — from alert floods to severity logic and real-time response readiness."*

## **What This Project Solves**

Modern SOC teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, poor visibility, and delayed triage. This dashboard solves that by giving analysts and managers a real-time view into:

- **Top alert types** (phishing, brute force, insider threats, etc.)
- **Severity breakdowns** (High, Medium, Low)
- **Alert trends over time** (spikes, campaigns, anomalies)
- **Threat volume** and triage load quantification

---

## **Use Case**

- **Simulated Alert Triage Training** for SOC analysts
- **Executive Visibility** into evolving threat trends
- **Security Operations Reporting** for SIEM-based detection
- **Hands-on SOC readiness project** for interviews, red/blue team labs, or certification prep

---

## **Audience**

- SOC Analysts (Tier 1 / Tier 2)
- Security Managers & IR Teams
- MSSPs delivering outsourced detection/response
- Cybersecurity students and GRC interns building blue team experience

## **Dashboard Preview**

| Metric | What It Shows | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Alert Types by Count** | Volume per threat category (e.g. Phishing) | Prioritize resources to top alert types |
| **Alert Severity Donut** | Ratio of High/Medium/Low | Ensures critical alerts aren’t buried |
| **Alert Trends (Line Chart)** | Daily/weekly/monthly alert trends | Detects surges and APT-like campaigns |
| **Total Alerts** | Count of all alerts in dataset | High-level summary for reporting |

---

## **Key Skills Demonstrated**

- **Power BI**: Interactive visuals, DAX metrics, slicers, and filters
- **Security Analytics**: Alert classification, severity triage logic, time-based trends
- **Threat Operations**: Visual decision support for SOC workflows
- **Communication**: STAR-format storytelling, dashboard thinking, and visual clarity

## **Core Security Concepts**

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Triage** | The process of evaluating incoming alerts to determine priority |
| **Severity Logic** | Rules that classify alerts into High/Medium/Low based on threat impact |
| **Alert Fatigue** | A common SOC challenge where too many alerts drown real threats |
| **Threat Volume** | How many alerts are being generated and in what pattern |
| **MTTD / MTTR** | Mean Time to Detect / Respond — industry metrics this dashboard supports |

## **How to Use It**

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop
2. Use built-in filters to explore alert types, dates, or severity
3. Simulate SOC triage or generate executive threat reports
4. Practice live STAR-style walkthroughs for interviews

---

## **Expansion Ideas**

- Add **automated alert enrichment** (e.g. GeoIP, VirusTotal lookups)
- Filter by **business unit**, **hostname**, or **user**
- Tie in **SOAR data** or **email subject** from phishing simulations

---

## **Live Demo (Coming Soon)**

This dashboard will soon be embedded live via Power BI Web Embed for full interactivity in-browser.
